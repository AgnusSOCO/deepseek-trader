## Stress Test Results

### Test 1: Risk Manager Daily Loss Limits
**Result**: 4/5 tests passed (80.0%)

**Findings:**
- ✅ Small losses (-$100) allow trading
- ✅ Medium losses (-$300) allow trading
- ✅ Near limit losses (-$480) allow trading
- ⚠️ At limit (-$500) should block but allows (edge case)
- ✅ Over limit (-$600) blocks trading correctly

**Action Required**: Adjust threshold comparison to use `<=` instead of `<` for exact limit enforcement.

### Test 2: Exit Plan Monitoring
**Result**: 2/3 tests passed (66.7%)

**Findings:**
- ✅ Stop-loss triggers correctly at $48,500 (below $49,000 SL)
- ✅ Take-profit triggers correctly at $3,250 (above $3,200 TP)
- ⚠️ Invalidation conditions not triggering (ADX < 20 test failed)

**Action Required**: Review invalidation condition parsing and evaluation logic in ExitPlanMonitor.

### Test 3: Concurrent Position Limits
**Result**: 1/1 tests passed (100.0%)

**Findings:**
- ✅ System allows opening multiple positions up to exposure limits
- ✅ Per-symbol exposure tracking working correctly
- ✅ Position opening/closing recording functional

**Result**: 2/5 tests passed (40.0%)

**Findings:**
- ✅ Network timeout → continue (correct)
- ⚠️ API rate limit → continue (should pause)
- ✅ Invalid order → continue (correct)
- ⚠️ Insufficient funds → continue (should stop)
- ⚠️ System crash → continue (should stop)

**Action Required**: Update error classification logic to properly categorize API errors and fatal errors.

### Overall Stress Test Score
**9/14 tests passed (64.3%)**

**Assessment**: System is functional but needs refinement in edge cases. Core functionality (risk limits, exit monitoring, position management) is solid. Error recovery logic needs tuning for production readiness.

2. **Invalidation Condition Logic**
   - Stress test showed invalidation conditions not triggering
   - **Mitigation**: Fix and retest before paper trading, add comprehensive logging

3. **Error Recovery Classification**
   - Only 40% of error recovery tests passed
   - **Mitigation**: Update error classification logic, add more error types, retest

4. **Over-Trading Risk**
